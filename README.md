    <h1>A Simple Website with Integrated Payment Gateway</h1>
    <p>This project is a simple website with a payment gateway integrated. The website allows users to donate money by clicking on a donate button on the homepage, which will then redirect them to a payment page where they can select the amount to be paid and the payment type. Once the payment is made, an invoice will be generated.</p>
    
    Installation
    To run the project, you need to have the following:
    
      A web server installed on your machine
      vs code
      An account with a payment gateway provider (i used paypal)
    
    
   Next, you need to configure the payment gateway provider you are using. This involves setting up an account with them, obtaining your API keys, and configuring the project files to use them. Please refer to the documentation provided by your payment gateway provider for more information on how to do this.
